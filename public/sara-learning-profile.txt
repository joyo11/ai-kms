SECTION IV. DESCRIPTION OF PROCESS FLOW AND PROJECT SCHEDULE
PRESENTATION AND EXPLANATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - WORK STEPS,
MILESTONES, SCHEDULE
Good design, planning, and implementation are crucial for every type of training program. We will use the
ADDIE model (analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate) for the four online training sessions
(webinars) covering the defined curriculum for all 300 WLBs. Here, we will first present and elaborate on
the identified work processes, followed by the operational work plan.
Phase 1: Curriculum Review and Development
The training design/instructional design as the key document of the training plan. It is creating the
blueprint for the development of instruction and to implement the training plan, showing training
objectives, competencies, schedule, training methods, training resources, role of trainers, and follow-up
strategies. Based on the training plan, the detailed training design is develop as a guide for the trainer. The
process contains some steps; a) Formulation and sequencing of learning outcomes, b) Identification of
strategies, c) select instructional, media, delivery, and evaluation strategies, d) Development of training
plan that outlines information; who will deliver the training online thorough digital platform. Lastly, we
provide a contingency plan which outlines possible scenarios. Lastly, beneficiaries will be selected
together with ITC (participants with basic digital skills and online presence).
Collaborate with ITC to finalize the training curriculum on digital tools, data analytics, AI, and digital
marketing.
Refine the curriculum based on ITC feedback to ensure it meets project objectives and WLB needs.
Work with ITC to select 300 WLBs with basic digital skills and online presence.
Phase 2: Conduct Online Training and In-Country Workshop
The time when the training and In-Country workshop will be conducted. We will be informed at least 4
weeks before the online-training and at least 6 weeks before the start of the In-Country workshop. The
training is carried out in online format. This will allow to develop and/or translate learning material
tailored to the specific training request and preparation of agenda. It is planned to conduct online training
for 300 WLB.
Deliver four online training sessions (webinars) covering the defined curriculum to all 300 WLBs.
Utilize online platforms provided by Sara Learning Global to conduct the webinars.
Provide participants with training materials (presentations, PDFs) and record webinar sessions.
Collect participant evaluations and track training completion data.
Partner with ITC to organize a 2-day in-country workshop for 100 WLBs.
Facilitate workshop sessions focused on applying AI, data analytics, and digital marketing for business
growth.
Provide workshop participants with necessary materials and resources.
Collect participant feedback and workshop evaluation data.
Submit a report to ITC detailing workshop activities, content, attendance, and results.

PROJECT PROPOSAL

Phase 3: Participants’ evaluation of the training modules and coaching sessions
We will develop evaluation sheets following the sequence and methodology of the Kirkpatrick training
evaluation model. The Kirkpatrick training evaluation model has four levels, reaction, learning, behaviour
and results/impact of training. In our training evaluation, directly after the training, we will provide a
questionnaire in which we can get the immediate feedback/reaction of the participant about the
satisfaction regarding the training delivery mode, the usefulness of the training, capacity of knowledge
transfer into the work-life. Level 3 and 4 can be discussed with the project management team and might
be useful if desired to be conducted after 6 months of the training. We adhere full compliance with the
law to protect the data under the standards of the GDPR, in particular the Art. 44-50 GDPR and comply
with the applicable obligations under data protection legislation.
Categorize WLBs into small groups (max 5 participants) based on digital skills, products/services, etc.
(in collaboration with ITC).
Deliver 3 online coaching sessions (2 hours each) per group, providing personalized guidance on
applying AI/ML in their businesses.
Record coaching sessions for future reference.
Follow up with each WLB after coaching to assess their progress in implementing an AI/ML strategy.
Collect information on participants' digital transformation efforts and the impact on business growth.
Conduct surveys or interviews with WLBs to gauge their learning outcomes and satisfaction.
Compile a final report for ITC with individual reports on each WLB's AI/ML strategy, implemented
changes, and business growth impact.
We intend to provide technical support to participants to allow everybody to participate in due time and
know how to use the digital learning facilities. We assume that there is a need to support the participants’
computer and digital literacy level. In case of low internet connectivity, we intend to provide another
access to follow the training. The LMS of Sara Learning Global may have such provisions.
We will maintain regular communication with ITC throughout the project lifecycle. Moreover, we will
share progress reports and address any concerns promptly. Be open to feedback and adapt the training
approach as needed.
By following this process flow and project schedule, Sara Learning Global can effectively deliver the
SheTrades & UPS Project and empower Nigerian women entrepreneurs with the digital skills needed to
thrive in today's marketplace.
Design with Local Stakeholders
The development of trainings based on local context is one of the central pillars of our strategy. All IDD
documents and their content shall not primarily be developed by international providers, but also by local
experts, keeping in mind the situation and context in AU. For this reason, expert focuses on design thinking
process and on co- creation approaches. With this principle, a localization and contextualization of resources
can be implemented.
