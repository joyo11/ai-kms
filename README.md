# SARA AI-KMS

## Overview
SARA AI-KMS is an AI-powered knowledge management chatbot developed for SARA Learning. The system streamlines staff onboarding, training, and productivity by providing instant, structured answers from internal company documents. The chatbot features a modern, button-based interface and leverages a robust backend for real-time document retrieval and response generation.

## Design Decisions, Assumptions, and Technical Tidbits

### Chatbot Flow and Knowledge Retrieval
- **Button-Based Interaction:** The chatbot UI is designed for intuitive, button-driven navigation. Users select from predefined options to receive detailed, context-rich answers, ensuring a guided and user-friendly experience.
- **Document-Driven Responses:** All chatbot answers are sourced from four core internal documents (proposals, training materials, templates, and process documentation), ensuring accuracy and compliance with company knowledge.
- **Backend Integration:** The frontend (built with React/Next.js and Tailwind CSS, hosted on Vercel) communicates in real time with a Python backend (LangChain + Chroma) via a secure Ngrok tunnel. This enables dynamic retrieval and embedding of document content.
- **Context Awareness:** The system is designed to eventually support conversational context, allowing for follow-up questions and more natural dialogue.
- **Debounce and Duplicate Handling:** User input is debounced to prevent duplicate queries, and identical questions are blocked if submitted in rapid succession.

### Other Key Design Choices
- **Modern Stack:** Next.js 15, React 18, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript for the frontend; Python, LangChain, and Chroma for the backend.
- **Secure API Bridge:** Ngrok is used to securely expose the local backend to the Vercel-hosted frontend during development and testing.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Users can rate bot responses (üëç/üëé) to help improve answer quality.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Bot responses use bold headers, bullet points, and icons for clarity and readability.

### Assumptions
- **Internal Knowledge Base:** All responses are strictly based on the four uploaded internal documents.
- **Button-First UX:** The chatbot is primarily button-driven, with free-text input as a secondary option.
- **English Language:** The system is designed for English-language interactions.

### Technical Tidbits
- **Auto-scroll:** The chat window always scrolls to the latest message for a seamless experience.
- **Session Handling:** The frontend manages chat state and disables input while the bot is responding.
- **Consistent Theming:** The UI maintains a dark, professional look throughout, with no white space or page overflow.
